One if not *the* main principle of a Zettelkasten is the principle of connection. 

There are typically three entities mentioned:

1. Data
2. Information
3. Knowledge

There are in a hierarchy with data being the simplest and knowledge the most sophisticated. One of the big questions out there is: How can you get from data to information to knowledge? 

Every attempt to answer this questions has one thing in common: Connection. 

1. What to connect Data, Information, Knowledge?
2. How to connect Data, Information, Knowledge?

While we don't have a theoretical answer to this theoretical question we can give the practical solution to knowledge work with quite robust confidence: Make connection possibel.

There are different types of connection:

1. Direct links..................... [[201705091535]]
